# 3D Printer Control MKII
This is the GitHub repository for the project: https://buildcomics.com/ (TO Be Determined) \
You will also find the "instructions"  there!

## Models
Find all the models for the keyboard here: (TODO)

## Main Code
The main code is based on Tinyusb: https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb \
The device should mimic a telephony HID device, as specified by Microsoft teams here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/certification/test-spec \
The actual document with the specs is in this zip file: https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/f/6/9f63c68d-817b-40ff-935c-9dd8b74cb07d/V4%20Release.zip  \
file name: Teams_DevicesGeneralSpecification_4_0_final.pdf
\
also interesting, the SkypeforBusiness_CallDisplaySpecification_3_0_Final.pdf has custom HID usage pages for display setup. This could be more usefull to make a busylight of. \ I'm planning on getting my USB busylight from the office to steal it's HID Descriptors and see what they do.

More usefull explanation here: https://eleccelerator.com/tutorial-about-usb-hid-report-descriptors/

\

And background spec: https://www.usb.org/hid

\

And a more readable explanation of this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/hid-usages

## Testing
Command to test HID descriptor of file: \
`sudo usbhid-dump -a 1:58 | grep -v : | xxd -r  -p | hidrd-convert -o spec`
\
using the hidrd tool from: https://github.com/DIGImend/hidrd

## Wiring
TODO

## Raspberry Pi Pico
Assuming you have the raspberry pi pico c SDK installed(https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) \
The following (standard) commands will create "main.uf2" that can be copied onto the raspberry pi in bootsel mode:
1. git clone git@github.com:buildcomics/mst_keyboard.git
2. cd mst_keyboard
3. mkdir build
4. cd build
5. cmake ..
6. make
7. Now press the button on your raspbery pi pico, connect it and copy the main.uf2 to the pico that should show up ass a mass storage device
